# Git service mover

The goal of this library is to allow moving a project from a git hosting provider
to another.

For the moment, only 3 providers are managed :

* Github through : [knplabs/github-api](https://packagist.org/packages/knplabs/github-api)
* Gitlab through : [m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api](https://packagist.org/packages/m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api)
* BitBucket through : [gentle/bitbucket-api](https://packagist.org/packages/gentle/bitbucket-api)
